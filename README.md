# 🛡️ VoIPDefender — Defensive VoIP Monitoring, Detection & Forensics Platform

## 📖 Overview

**VoIPDefender** is an isolated, reproducible **VoIP defense and forensics platform** designed to capture, detect, and investigate VoIP (SIP/RTP) attacks **within a controlled lab environment**.
It focuses on **defensive monitoring, anomaly detection, and forensic reconstruction** — enabling analysts to **detect, investigate, and remediate** simulated VoIP hijack or tamper attempts.

> ⚠️ **Ethical Notice:**
> All experiments are conducted **only within lab-owned or consenting endpoints**.
> No real-world interception or unauthorized monitoring is performed.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Develop a **real-time VoIP defense system** capable of detecting registration hijacks and RTP tampering.
* Enable **forensic reconstruction and transcription** of authorized VoIP calls.
* Provide **incident timelines, alerts, and playbooks** to support investigation and remediation.
* Showcase **hands-on network forensics, SIEM integration, and VoIP attack detection** capabilities.

## ⚙️ Functional Architecture

### 1. 🕵️ Network Sniffing

* Capture SIP/RTP traffic on lab VLANs or mirrored interfaces.
* Parse and extract:

  * SIP messages: `REGISTER`, `INVITE`, `200 OK`, etc.
  * RTP metadata: SSRC, sequence numbers, timestamps, codecs.
* Store structured metadata (call-ids, endpoints, timestamps) in a searchable datastore (Elasticsearch).

### 2. 🚨 Simulated Attack Detection *(Lab Only)*

* Perform **controlled simulations** of SIP hijack/spoof events using test phones or softphones.
* Detect:

  * Suspicious registrations (unexpected IPs, rapid re-registers, Contact header mismatches).
  * RTP tampering anomalies (SSRC changes, abnormal payloads, jitter, codec mismatches).
* Correlate and raise automated **alerts** in SIEM dashboards for analyst triage.

### 3. 🔍 Call Analysis (With Consent)

* Reconstruct RTP audio streams from PCAPs.
* Convert audio to standard formats (`.wav`, `.mp3`) via `ffmpeg` or `sox`.
* Run **speech-to-text transcription** using open-source models (e.g., **Whisper**).
* Extract and normalize:

  * SIP headers: `From`, `To`, `P-Asserted-Identity`.
  * Transport and signaling metadata (IP, ASN, GeoIP for lab-simulated IPs).
* Generate **tamper-evidence metrics**: packet loss, jitter, sequence gaps, codec anomalies.

### 4. 🧠 Alerting, Triage & Playbooks

* Integrate with **Elasticsearch/Kibana** or **Splunk** for:

  * Alert generation and prioritization.
  * Context enrichment (GeoIP, ASN, device inventory).
  * Analyst triage and visualization.
* Include **incident response playbooks**:

  1. Validate alert
  2. Collect evidence (PCAPs, logs)
  3. Contain (block IPs, quarantine accounts)
  4. Remediate (rotate SIP credentials, enforce SRTP/TLS)
  5. Report findings

## ✅ Expected Outcomes

1. **Real-time Detection:**
   Detect and flag suspicious SIP registration or RTP tampering behaviors within the lab.

2. **Audio Reconstruction & Transcription:**
   Reconstruct authorized VoIP calls, extract audio streams, and generate transcripts.

3. **Forensic Timelines & Attribution:**
   Correlate SIP and RTP events to produce incident timelines and identify root causes (e.g., misconfigurations, replay attempts, credential guessing).

4. **Complete Blue-Team Workflow Demonstration:**
   From detection → investigation → containment → remediation → reporting.
